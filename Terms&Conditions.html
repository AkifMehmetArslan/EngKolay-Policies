    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>These terms and conditions apply to the EngKolay app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices
      that was created by Lemonworks Apps (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service.</p>

    <h2>Usage Agreement</h2>
    <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is
      strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.
      Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is
      strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into
      other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights,
      and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As
      such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any
      reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly
      communicated to you.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection & Security</h2>
    <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to
      provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
      Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves
      removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such
      actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security
      features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions.
      Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the
      Application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://expo.io/terms" target="_blank">Expo</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of
      the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
      provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity
      due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
    <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's
      agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during
      the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept
      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your
      home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
      device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill
      payer.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For
      instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
      battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>
    <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that
      while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
      provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability
      for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of
      the application.</p>

    <h2>Updates & Compatibility</h2>
    <p>The application is currently available based on the operating system requirements. If these requirements change
      or the application expands to other systems, you may need to download updates to continue using the application.
      The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
      application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version
      installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.
      The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time
      without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
      rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if
      necessary) delete it from your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review
      this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new
      Terms and Conditions on this page.
